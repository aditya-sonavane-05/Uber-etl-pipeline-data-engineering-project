## Introduction
The goal of this project is to perform data analytics on Uber data using various tools and technologies, including GCP Storage, Python, Compute Instance, Mage Data Pipeline Tool, BigQuery, and Looker Studio. This project focuses on analyzing the TLC Trip Record Data, which includes pick-up and drop-off dates/times, locations, trip distances, fares, rate types, payment types, and passenger counts.
